# 제45화

눈을 떴다.

---

---

낯선 천장.

---

---

---

---

몸이 무거웠다.

---

---

---

---

옆구리가 욱신거렸다.

---

---

---

---

---

"깨어났어."

---

---

---

---

익숙한 목소리.

---

---

---

---

핀이었다.

---

---

---

---

"여기가..."

---

---

---

---

"왕궁 의무실."

---

---

핀이 말했다.

---

---

"이틀 동안 의식이 없었어."

---

---

---

---

---

이틀.

---

---

---

---

기억이 돌아왔다.

---

---

---

---

대조회실.

---

---

봉인.

---

---

루드비히의 검.

---

---

---

---

그리고.

---

---

---

---

"레온하르트는?"

---

---

---

---

핀의 표정이 굳었다.

---

---

---

---

"살아있어."

---

---

---

---

"상처 없이."

---

---

---

---

"근데..."

---

---

---

---

---

핀이 말을 멈췄다.

---

---

---

---

"근데 뭐?"

---

---

---

---

---

"이상해졌어."

---

---

핀이 조심스럽게 말했다.

---

---

"눈이 금빛으로 바뀌었어."

---

---

---

---

"그 후로 아무도 안 만나."

---

---

---

---

"너도."

---

---

---

---

---

사냥꾼.

---

---

---

---

각성했다.

---

---

---

---

본능이 깨어났다.

---

---

---

---

마족을 사냥하라는.

---

---

---

---

그리고 나는.

---

---

---

---

마족이다.

---

---

---

---

---

웃음이 났다.

---

---

---

---

"당연하지."

---

---

---

---

핀이 고개를 갸웃했다.

---

---

---

---

---

설명할 수 없었다.

---

---

---

---

아직은.

---

---

---

---

---

"일어나도 돼?"

---

---

---

---

핀이 눈을 찡그렸다.

---

---

---

"안 돼."

---

---

---

---

"의원이 일주일은 누워있으래."

---

---

---

---

---

"어디 가려고?"

---

---

---

---

---

창밖을 봤다.

---

---

---

---

해가 지고 있었다.

---

---

---

---

"그를 만나야 해."

---

---

---

---

---

핀의 얼굴이 굳었다.

---

---

---

---

"지금?"

---

---

---

---

"상처도 안 나았는데?"

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

"지금이 아니면 안 돼."

---

---

---

---

---

핀이 한숨을 쉬었다.

---

---

---

---

"알았어."

---

---

---

---

"도와줄게."

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

왕궁 서쪽 별관.

---

---

---

---

레온하르트에게 배정된 방.

---

---

---

---

핀이 문 앞에서 멈췄다.

---

---

---

---

"여기까지만."

---

---

---

---

"뒤에서 기다릴게."

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

문을 두드렸다.

---

---

---

---

대답이 없었다.

---

---

---

---

---

손잡이를 돌렸다.

---

---

---

---

잠겨있지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

방 안은 어두웠다.

---

---

---

---

촛불 하나 켜져있지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

창문으로 들어오는 희미한 빛.

---

---

---

---

---

그가 거기 있었다.

---

---

---

---

창가에.

---

---

---

---

등을 돌리고.

---

---

---

---

---

"레온하르트."

---

---

---

---

불렀다.

---

---

---

---

그가 몸을 굳혔다.

---

---

---

---

---

"오지 마."

---

---

---

---

낮은 목소리였다.

---

---

---

---

갈라져 있었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"왜?"

---

---

---

---

---

"위험해."

---

---

---

---

그가 말했다.

---

---

---

---

"내가."

---

---

---

---

"너에게."

---

---

---

---

---

한 발짝 다가갔다.

---

---

---

---

옆구리가 욱신거렸지만 무시했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"알아."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"사냥꾼이 뭔지."

---

---

---

---

"마족이 뭔지."

---

---

---

---

---

그가 천천히 돌아섰다.

---

---

---

---

---

금빛 눈.

---

---

---

---

전에 없던 빛.

---

---

---

---

날카로웠다.

---

---

---

---

야수 같았다.

---

---

---

---

---

그 눈이 나를 봤다.

---

---

---

---

---

순간.

---

---

---

---

온몸에 소름이 돋았다.

---

---

---

---

---

천적.

---

---

---

---

본능이 경고했다.

---

---

---

---

도망쳐.

---

---

---

---

---

하지만 움직이지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

---

"느껴져?"

---

---

---

---

물었다.

---

---

---

---

"나를 사냥하고 싶은 충동."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 손이 떨렸다.

---

---

---

---

"멈출 수가 없어."

---

---

---

---

그가 말했다.

---

---

---

---

"네가 보이면."

---

---

---

---

"잡고 싶어져."

---

---

---

---

"목을."

---

---

---

---

"조르고 싶어져."

---

---

---

---

---

목소리가 떨렸다.

---

---

---

---

고통스러워 보였다.

---

---

---

---

---

"그게 본능이야."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"사냥꾼의."

---

---

---

---

---

한 발짝 더 다가갔다.

---

---

---

---

그가 뒤로 물러섰다.

---

---

---

---

---

"오지 마!"

---

---

---

---

외쳤다.

---

---

---

---

"내가 너를 해칠 수도 있어!"

---

---

---

---

---

멈추지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

한 걸음.

---

---

---

---

또 한 걸음.

---

---

---

---

---

그가 벽에 등이 닿았다.

---

---

---

---

더 이상 물러날 곳이 없었다.

---

---

---

---

---

금빛 눈이 나를 노려봤다.

---

---

---

---

살기가 느껴졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

하지만.

---

---

---

---

그 안에.

---

---

---

---

공포도 있었다.

---

---

---

---

---

나를 해칠까 봐 두려워하는.

---

---

---

---

그런 눈.

---

---

---

---

---

손을 뻗었다.

---

---

---

---

그의 뺨에 닿았다.

---

---

---

---

---

차가웠다.

---

---

---

---

땀에 젖어있었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"레온하르트."

---

---

---

---

불렀다.

---

---

---

---

---

"나 봐."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 눈이 흔들렸다.

---

---

---

---

금빛 속에서.

---

---

---

---

익숙한 눈빛이 보였다.

---

---

---

---

내가 아는 그.

---

---

---

---

---

"본능을 거슬러."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"전에도 그랬잖아."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 숨이 거칠어졌다.

---

---

---

---

"어둠의 포옹."

---

---

---

---

"네 능력이 나한테 안 통한 것."

---

---

---

---

"그건 사냥꾼의 본능이었어."

---

---

---

---

---

"그런데도 넌."

---

---

---

---

"나한테 다가왔어."

---

---

---

---

"본능을 거스르고."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 눈에서 빛이 흔들렸다.

---

---

---

---

---

"지금도 할 수 있어."

---

---

---

---

---

손이 떨렸다.

---

---

---

---

그의 뺨에서 떨어질 것 같았다.

---

---

---

---

---

하지만 그가 먼저 잡았다.

---

---

---

---

내 손을.

---

---

---

---

---

힘이 들어가 있었다.

---

---

---

---

거의 아플 정도로.

---

---

---

---

---

"무서워."

---

---

---

---

그가 말했다.

---

---

---

---

처음 듣는 목소리였다.

---

---

---

---

떨리고.

---

---

---

---

연약했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"너를 해칠까 봐."

---

---

---

---

"내가 통제할 수 없을까 봐."

---

---

---

---

---

웃음이 났다.

---

---

---

---

"바보."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"나도 마족이야."

---

---

---

---

"사람의 기억을 빨아먹는."

---

---

---

---

"생명력을 흡수하는."

---

---

---

---

---

"네가 무서워하는 것보다."

---

---

---

---

"내가 한 일이 더 끔찍해."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 눈이 커졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

"그래도 넌."

---

---

---

---

"나한테 손을 내밀었잖아."

---

---

---

---

---

손을 비틀어 그의 손을 잡았다.

---

---

---

---

엮었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"이번엔 내 차례야."

---

---

---

---

---

---

침묵.

---

---

---

---

긴 침묵.

---

---

---

---

---

그의 숨소리만 들렸다.

---

---

---

---

거칠다가.

---

---

---

---

점점 잦아들었다.

---

---

---

---

---

금빛 눈이 흔들렸다.

---

---

---

---

점점.

---

---

---

---

빛이 옅어졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

그리고.

---

---

---

---

---

원래의 눈.

---

---

---

---

깊고 차가운.

---

---

---

---

하지만 온기가 있는.

---

---

---

---

그 눈으로 돌아왔다.

---

---

---

---

---

"로잘린드."

---

---

---

---

그가 불렀다.

---

---

---

---

목소리가 갈라졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

"미안해."

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 저었다.

---

---

---

---

"사과할 거 없어."

---

---

---

---

---

"나도 너한테 숨긴 게 많으니까."

---

---

---

---

---

---

그가 천천히 고개를 숙였다.

---

---

---

---

이마가 내 어깨에 닿았다.

---

---

---

---

---

따뜻했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"전부 말해줘."

---

---

---

---

그가 속삭였다.

---

---

---

---

"숨긴 것."

---

---

---

---

"네가 누군지."

---

---

---

---

"전부."

---

---

---

---

---

눈을 감았다.

---

---

---

---

---

이제 숨길 이유가 없었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"로잘린드 아스텔."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"그게 내 진짜 이름이야."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 몸이 굳었다.

---

---

---

---

하지만 멀어지지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

---

"솔베른 가문."

---

---

---

---

"내 첫사랑의 가문."

---

---

---

---

"거기서 자랐어."

---

---

---

---

---

"열다섯 살 때."

---

---

---

---

"네 아버지가 우리 가문을 멸문시켰어."

---

---

---

---

---

말하면서 목이 막혔다.

---

---

---

---

---

"나는 살아남았어."

---

---

---

---

"루시엔이 나를 숨겨줘서."

---

---

---

---

"그리고 그는..."

---

---

---

---

---

말을 잇지 못했다.

---

---

---

---

---

그가 고개를 들었다.

---

---

---

---

눈이 마주쳤다.

---

---

---

---

---

"알아."

---

---

---

---

그가 말했다.

---

---

---

---

"아버지가 무슨 짓을 했는지."

---

---

---

---

---

"그래서..."

---

---

---

---

"네가 나한테 접근한 것도."

---

---

---

---

"복수였던 거지?"

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

부정할 수 없었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"처음에는."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"근데..."

---

---

---

---

---

말이 막혔다.

---

---

---

---

---

"달라졌어."

---

---

---

---

---

---

그가 웃었다.

---

---

---

---

슬프게.

---

---

---

---

하지만 진심으로.

---

---

---

---

---

"나도."

---

---

---

---

---

손이 내 머리카락을 쓸었다.

---

---

---

---

부드럽게.

---

---

---

---

---

"처음 봤을 때부터."

---

---

---

---

"이상했어."

---

---

---

---

"본능이 경고했어."

---

---

---

---

"위험하다고."

---

---

---

---

---

"근데 멀어질 수가 없었어."

---

---

---

---

---

그의 눈이 빛났다.

---

---

---

---

금빛이 아니라.

---

---

---

---

다른 빛.

---

---

---

---

---

"그게 뭔지 이제 알아."

---

---

---

---

---

---

손을 들어.

---

---

---

---

그의 얼굴을 감쌌다.

---

---

---

---

---

"우리는 천적이야."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"사냥꾼과 마족."

---

---

---

---

---

"본능은 우리가 싸우라고 해."

---

---

---

---

---

"근데..."

---

---

---

---

---

이마를 그의 이마에 댔다.

---

---

---

---

---

"난 싸우기 싫어."

---

---

---

---

---

---

그가 숨을 들이쉬었다.

---

---

---

---

떨리게.

---

---

---

---

---

"나도."

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

밖에서 발소리가 들렸다.

---

---

---

---

멀어졌다가 가까워졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

시간이 얼마 없었다.

---

---

---

---

---

"루드비히는?"

---

---

---

---

물었다.

---

---

---

---

---

그의 표정이 굳었다.

---

---

---

---

"지하에 감금됐어."

---

---

---

---

"반역죄로."

---

---

---

---

---

"재판은?"

---

---

---

---

"일주일 후."

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

---

"끝까지 볼 거야."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

"네 아버지가 심판받는 것."

---

---

---

---

---

"그게 내 복수의 끝이야."

---

---

---

---

---

---

그가 나를 바라봤다.

---

---

---

---

오래.

---

---

---

---

깊게.

---

---

---

---

---

"그 다음엔?"

---

---

---

---

---

질문이 무거웠다.

---

---

---

---

---

"모르겠어."

---

---

---

---

솔직하게 말했다.

---

---

---

---

"복수만 생각하고 살았으니까."

---

---

---

---

---

"그 다음은..."

---

---

---

---

---

그가 손을 내밀었다.

---

---

---

---

내 손을 잡았다.

---

---

---

---

---

"같이 생각하자."

---

---

---

---

---

---

눈이 뜨거워졌다.

---

---

---

---

울지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

그냥 고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

---

"그래."

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

창밖에서 해가 완전히 졌다.

---

---

---

---

방 안이 어두워졌다.

---

---

---

---

---

하지만.

---

---

---

---

무섭지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

---

그의 손이 따뜻했으니까.

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

문 밖에서 핀의 목소리가 들렸다.

---

---

---

---

"로잘린드."

---

---

---

---

"의원이 찾아."

---

---

---

---

---

한숨을 쉬었다.

---

---

---

---

"가야겠다."

---

---

---

---

---

그가 고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

손을 놓지 않았다.

---

---

---

---

---

"내일."

---

---

---

---

그가 말했다.

---

---

---

---

"다시 와."

---

---

---

---

---

웃었다.

---

---

---

---

"올게."

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

문을 열고 나갔다.

---

---

---

---

핀이 기다리고 있었다.

---

---

---

---

표정이 복잡했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"괜찮아?"

---

---

---

---

물었다.

---

---

---

---

---

고개를 끄덕였다.

---

---

---

---

---

"이제."

---

---

---

---

말했다.

---

---

---

---

---

"괜찮아."

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

진심이었다.

---

---

---

---

---

처음으로.

---

---

---

---

진심으로 괜찮았다.
